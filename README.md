# Roblox Dig It Script

Welcome to the **Roblox Dig It Script** repository! This script is a powerful and customizable tool designed for developers and game creators looking to enhance their Roblox games with digging mechanics. Whether you’re building an exploration game, a mining simulation, or an adventure game, this script will provide you with the functionality needed to implement realistic and engaging digging features.

## Features

- **Interactive Digging Mechanism:** Allows players to dig into the ground, unearth treasures, and interact with the environment.
- **Customizable Terrain:** Easily modify the terrain’s properties to make digging deeper or more challenging.
- **Smooth Animation:** The digging action is accompanied by smooth animations, providing a realistic experience.
- **Modular Design:** The script is highly modular, meaning it can be easily integrated into any Roblox game with minimal adjustments.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Carefully optimized to work on both high-end and low-end devices, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience for all users.
- **Multi-player Support:** Designed to work seamlessly in multi-player games, allowing players to dig and interact with the environment together.

## How to Use

Once the **Roblox Dig It Script** is installed in your game, players can use the digging feature directly. The script enables players to interact with specific parts of the terrain (e.g., dirt or sand) by using a simple click or button press. You can modify the script to adjust the type of terrain or items that can be dug up, such as rare resources, treasure, or even special game rewards.

**Key Usage Functions:**
- `diggingActivation()` – Activates the digging animation and interaction.
- `setTerrainType(terrainType)` – Allows you to define what material is being dug.
